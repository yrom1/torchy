# requires_grad propogation

can you explain to me do internal tensors in pytorch, say if L = C.sum, C = A+B and A + B are inputs. which of these requires_grad = True? and which of these have .grad

---

In PyTorch, when you perform operations on tensors, the resulting tensor will have requires_grad set to True if at least one of the input tensors has requires_grad=True. In this case, let's assume that A and B are input tensors.

If at least one of A or B has requires_grad=True, the resulting tensor C (resulting from the operation A + B) will also have requires_grad=True. This means that C will be part of the computational graph and gradients will be computed for it during backpropagation. Similarly, if C has requires_grad=True, then the resulting tensor L (resulting from the operation C.sum()) will also have requires_grad=True.

Regarding the .grad attribute, it holds the gradients of a tensor with respect to some scalar value (usually the loss) that has been backpropagated through the computational graph. Only tensors with requires_grad=True will have their .grad attribute populated with gradient values after calling .backward() on the scalar value.

So, in summary:

If at least one of A or B has requires_grad=True, then C and L will also have requires_grad=True.
The .grad attribute will be populated for A, B, and C after calling .backward() on L. Note that L will not have a .grad attribute because it's a scalar value (the result of C.sum()), and gradients are computed with respect to this value.

Ryan Moore
okay so it's a straight forward thing where you set it on the inputs and it propagates whenever you interact with the inputs to product an output

---

Yes, that's correct. In PyTorch, when you perform operations with input tensors, the requires_grad property propagates automatically to the output tensors if at least one of the input tensors has requires_grad=True. This allows PyTorch to build a dynamic computational graph and compute gradients during backpropagation.

By setting requires_grad=True on input tensors, you inform PyTorch to track the gradients for those tensors and all tensors derived from them. When you call the .backward() method on the final scalar value (usually the loss), PyTorch will backpropagate the gradients through the computational graph and populate the .grad attribute for all tensors with requires_grad=True.

# backwards of tensor addition and sum of result

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <torch/torch.h>

int main() {
  // 2x2 tensors
  torch::Tensor a = torch::tensor({{1.0, 2.0}, {3.0, 4.0}}, torch::requires_grad(true));
  torch::Tensor b = torch::tensor({{2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0}}, torch::requires_grad(true));
  torch::Tensor c = a + b;

  // c.backward();
  /* BAD NO GOOD!
  ERORR The backward function in PyTorch requires a scalar output to compute gradients with respect to its input tensors.
  // : terminating with uncaught exception of type c10::Error: grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs
  */

  torch::Tensor scalar_output = c.sum();

  scalar_output.backward();

  std::cout << "a.grad: " << a.grad() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "b.grad: " << b.grad() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

*/
```

explain this output

---

In the given code, you create two tensors a and b, each with the shape (2, 2). Then, you add them together element-wise to get a new tensor c.

```css
a = | 1.0  2.0 |    b = | 2.0  3.0 |
    | 3.0  4.0 |        | 4.0  5.0 |
```

The resulting tensor c is:

```makefile
c = | 3.0  5.0 |
    | 7.0  9.0 |
```

Next, you compute the sum of all elements in tensor c to get a scalar output:

```makefile
scalar_output = 3.0 + 5.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 = 24.0
```

You then call scalar_output.backward() to compute the gradients for tensors a and b. Since the scalar output is a sum of all elements of c, and c is an element-wise sum of a and b, the gradient of each element in a and b with respect to the scalar output will be 1.

The gradients for tensors a and b are:

```css
a.grad = | 1  1 |
         | 1  1 |

b.grad = | 1  1 |
         | 1  1 |
```

The output you see in the terminal represents these gradient tensors:

```css
a.grad:  1  1
         1  1
[ CPUFloatType{2,2} ]
b.grad:  1  1
         1  1
[ CPUFloatType{2,2} ]
```

The CPUFloatType{2,2} in the output indicates that the gradient tensors are of type float and have a shape of (2, 2) and reside on the CPU device.

  edge_list next_edges_;
```
what is the point of edges in torch computation graph?

---

In the PyTorch computation graph, edges play an essential role in representing the connections between nodes. Each node represents a mathematical operation or a function, while the edges connect nodes in a directed manner to signify the flow of data (tensors) and gradients during the forward and backward passes.

Here's a quick breakdown of the purpose of edges:

Data flow: The edges represent the flow of tensors from one operation to another. This helps in executing operations in the correct order during the forward pass.

Dependencies: The edges define the dependencies between operations. This information is crucial during the backward pass for the calculation of gradients via backpropagation.

Gradient flow: During the backward pass, edges are responsible for carrying the gradients from one node to another, allowing the calculation of gradients for all nodes in the computation graph.

In the provided code snippet, the Edge struct contains a shared_ptr to the Node it points to (the function) and an identifier for the input of that function. This structure enables the representation of connections between nodes in the computation graph, facilitating the forward and backward passes.

---

Ryan Moore
are these pointers one way, which way starting form the loss function?
Yes, the pointers in the PyTorch computation graph are one-way or directed. They generally flow from the input nodes of the graph towards the output nodes (i.e., the loss function). During the forward pass, the computation flows from input nodes, through intermediate nodes, and towards the output nodes. Each node's output is computed using the values passed through incoming edges and is then propagated to the next nodes via outgoing edges.

When performing the backward pass for gradient calculation, the process is reversed. The gradients flow from the output nodes (starting from the loss function) towards the input nodes. However, it's essential to understand that the gradient flow still follows the direction of the edges in the computation graph. The backward pass utilizes the chain rule to compute gradients for each node, taking into account the gradients from downstream nodes and the local gradients of the node with respect to its inputs.

--

Ryan Moore
so in this case of edge, what is input_nr and what is funciton

---

In the provided Edge struct, the two member variables have the following meanings:

function: This is a std::shared_ptr<Node> that points to the Node this Edge connects to. In other words, it is a reference to the next operation (function) in the computation graph that will receive the output of the current node as input.

input_nr: This is a uint32_t variable representing the identifier of a particular input to the function. Since a node can have multiple inputs, input_nr is used to specify which input of the next Node the current output is connected to. This helps in keeping track of the tensor ordering and ensuring that the correct inputs are used for the next operation.

To summarize, an Edge in the PyTorch computation graph represents a connection between two nodes (operations). The function variable points to the next node in the graph, and the input_nr variable identifies the specific input of that next node to which the current node's output is connected.

---

Ryan Moore
in `C = A + B` where C is the output and `A` and `B` are the inputs. does Edge point from C to A and B or from A and B to C
In the expression C = A + B, where C is the output and A and B are the inputs, the edges in the computation graph would point from A and B to C.

In the context of the PyTorch computation graph:

Node A represents the first input tensor.
Node B represents the second input tensor.
Node C represents the output tensor resulting from the addition of A and B.
The edges will be directed from A and B to C to signify the flow of data (tensors) during the forward pass. These directed edges help ensure that operations are executed in the correct order, and they also represent dependencies between operations that are essential for the backward pass to calculate gradients via backpropagation.

---

Ryan Moore
so at the output node and you call .backwards on that tensor, if A's edge points to C, how would i get from C to A to do backpropogation from C to A

---

When you call .backward() on the output tensor (C in this case), PyTorch internally uses the computation graph to traverse from the output node back to the input nodes (A and B) to perform backpropagation.

To facilitate backpropagation, PyTorch maintains a list of incoming edges for each node. This list essentially contains the nodes and their respective gradients that contribute to the gradient of the current node during the backward pass. These incoming edges allow PyTorch to traverse the graph in the reverse order of the forward pass, calculating gradients for each node using the chain rule.

In the provided code snippet, the next_edges_ member variable in the Node struct is an example of such a list. It keeps track of the incoming edges to the node. While it's not shown in the snippet, during the backward pass, the incoming edges are used to propagate gradients in the reverse direction, starting from the output node (C) and moving towards the input nodes (A and B).

To summarize, PyTorch internally manages the backward traversal of the computation graph using the incoming edges list for each node, allowing it to perform backpropagation from the output node (C) back to the input nodes (A and B).

---

Ryan Moore
> PyTorch internally manages the backward traversal of the computation graph using the incoming edges list for each node,

can you explain this with refence to the structs/classes of torch mentioned proviously with a visual in ascii

---

Certainly! I'll use the expression C = A + B to create a visual representation of the forward and backward traversal of the computation graph using the PyTorch constructs mentioned earlier.

Let's assume we have three nodes: A, B, and C. The edges in the computation graph will be directed from nodes A and B to node C.

```css
  A   B
  |   |
  v   v
   \ /
    C
```
Now let's associate the Node and Edge structs with this visual representation:

```css

  [Node A]   [Node B]
      |          |
      v          v
      [Edge A]   [Edge B]
       \         /
        v       v
        [Node C]
```
In this graph, Edge A connects Node A to Node C, and Edge B connects Node B to Node C.

During the forward pass, the computation flows from Node A and Node B to Node C.

Now, let's talk about the backward pass. In this example, I'll demonstrate how the backward traversal is managed using the incoming edges list for each node.

For simplicity, let's assume that each Node has a member variable called incoming_edges_, which is a list of Edge pointers representing the incoming edges.


```cpp
struct Node {
  ...
  std::vector<Edge*> incoming_edges_;
  ...
};
```

When the computation graph is constructed, the incoming edges for each node are set as follows:

```css
Node A: incoming_edges_ = {}
Node B: incoming_edges_ = {}
Node C: incoming_edges_ = {&Edge A, &Edge B}
```
Now, when you call .backward() on the output tensor (C), PyTorch will traverse the graph using the incoming edges list for each node. In this case, it starts from Node C and moves towards Node A and Node B.

```
[Node C] <-- [Node A]
        <-- [Node B]
```
During the backward pass, gradients are calculated for each node using the chain rule, taking into account the gradients from downstream nodes (the nodes connected by incoming edges) and the local gradients of the node with respect to its inputs. This process is repeated recursively until the input nodes (A and B) are reached.

In summary, PyTorch uses the incoming_edges_ member variable to manage the backward traversal of the computation graph, allowing it to perform backpropagation from the output node (C) back to the input nodes (A and B).

---

Ryan Moore
```
[Node A] <-- [Node C] <-- [Node B]
```
is this correct?

---

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. I made an error in the ASCII representation of the backward pass. Here's the corrected version:

During the backward pass, the gradients are calculated for each node using the chain rule, taking into account the gradients from downstream nodes (the nodes connected by outgoing edges) and the local gradients of the node with respect to its inputs. This process is repeated recursively until the input nodes (A and B) are reached. The backward pass can be visualized like this:

```
[Node C] <-- [Node A]
        <-- [Node B]
```

The gradients flow from Node C back to both Node A and Node B. The computation graph is still traversed in reverse order, using the next_edges_ (outgoing edges) member variable in the Node struct.

In summary, PyTorch uses the next_edges_ member variable to manage the backward traversal of the computation graph, allowing it to perform backpropagation from the output node (C) back to the input nodes (A and B).

# neuron operations

To implement the core mathematical functionality for a simple feedforward neural network layer that performs a dot product of weights and inputs plus a bias term, you will need to add the following features to your Tensor library:

Matrix multiplication (dot product): Add a method for performing matrix multiplication between two Tensors. This method should check for compatible dimensions and perform the dot product accordingly.
```cpp
Tensor<T> matmul(const Tensor<T> &other) const {
  // Check dimensions compatibility and perform matrix multiplication
}
```
Addition: Add a method for performing element-wise addition of two Tensors or adding a scalar to a Tensor. This can be done using operator overloading.

```cpp
// Tensor addition
Tensor<T> operator+(const Tensor<T> &other) const {
  // Check dimensions compatibility and perform element-wise addition
}

// Scalar addition
Tensor<T> operator+(const T &scalar) const {
  // Perform scalar addition to each element
}
```

Broadcasting: Extend the addition functionality to support broadcasting, which allows you to perform element-wise operations between Tensors with different dimensions.
With these features in place, you will be able to perform the core functionality needed to calculate the output of a neuron:

```py
output = input.matmul(weights) + bias
```
Remember that this is just the core mathematical functionality, and there is no autograd or neural network-specific implementation included.

---

Matrix multiplication (matmul) is the operation that combines the inputs and the weights of a neural network layer. Let's break it down using a simple feedforward neural network layer as an example.

Suppose you have a single layer neural network with n input neurons and m output neurons. The input vector is of size (1, n), where each element is the value of an input neuron. The weights of the layer are organized in a matrix of size (n, m), where each column represents the weights connected to a specific output neuron, and each row represents the weights connected to a specific input neuron.

To calculate the dot product of the inputs and the weights, you perform a matrix multiplication (matmul) between the input vector and the weight matrix. This results in an output vector of size (1, m).

Mathematically, the matmul operation is defined as follows:
```
output[i] = sum(input[j] * weights[j][i]) for j in range(n)
```
Here, output[i] is the value of the i-th output neuron before the activation function is applied. The sum is taken over all the input neurons (from 0 to n-1).

In summary, the matrix multiplication operation combines the input values and the weights of the neural network layer, calculating the dot product for each output neuron, resulting in a vector of intermediate neuron values. Note that these values still need to have an activation function applied to them and potentially a bias term added, depending on your network architecture.

---

You're correct; the given equation is the element-wise version of the calculation for a single output neuron output[i]. To compute the output for all neurons in a vectorized manner, you can use matrix multiplication:

```
output = input x weights
```

Here, input is a row vector of size (1, n), weights is a matrix of size (n, m), and output is a row vector of size (1, m). The matrix multiplication combines all input values and the weights in a single, efficient operation, resulting in the output vector containing the dot product for each output neuron.

---

Yes, if you want a single output, you only need a single output neuron in that layer. In this case, the weight matrix would be of size (n, 1), where n is the number of input neurons. The resulting output vector, after the matrix multiplication, would be of size (1, 1).

In this scenario, the matrix multiplication would still work as expected, combining the input values and the weights connected to the single output neuron, resulting in the single output value.

---
Tensor contraction is a more general operation than batched matrix multiplication (BMM) and can be used to perform a variety of operations, including matrix multiplication, BMM, and other contractions along specified dimensions. However, tensor contraction isn't always the same as BMM.

In tensor contraction, you specify which dimensions of the input tensors to contract. If you set up the contraction indices to match BMM, the result will be the same. For example, let's say you have two tensors A and B with dimensions (batch_size, M, N) and (batch_size, N, P), respectively. You can perform BMM using tensor contraction by contracting the last dimension of the first tensor (N) with the second-to-last dimension of the second tensor (N):

```
C = contract(A, B, {2}, {1})
```

Here, C will have dimensions (batch_size, M, P), which is the same as the result of BMM.

However, tensor contraction can also be used to perform other types of contractions that do not correspond to BMM. For example, you could contract along the first dimensions of both input tensors, resulting in an output tensor of dimensions (M, P). This operation would not be equivalent to BMM.

So, while tensor contraction can be used to perform BMM, it is a more general operation that can also be used for other types of contractions. To get the same result as BMM, you need to set up the contraction indices correctly.

---

In PyTorch, the underlying ATen library provides low-level tensor operations, including matrix multiplication. The matmul function in PyTorch is implemented to handle tensors that aren't matrices by following NumPy's broadcasting rules for linear algebra operations.

For tensors with more than two dimensions, PyTorch's matmul performs batched matrix multiplication. If the input tensors A and B have dimensions (batch_size, M, N) and (batch_size, N, P), respectively, the matmul operation will perform a matrix multiplication for each pair of 2D matrices (slices) along the batch dimension, resulting in an output tensor C of dimensions (batch_size, M, P).

If the input tensors have different batch dimensions, matmul will attempt to broadcast them to a common shape before performing the batched matrix multiplication. Broadcasting rules state that dimensions are compatible if they are equal or if one of them is 1. Incompatible dimensions will result in a runtime error.

Here's an example using PyTorch's torch.matmul:

```py
import torch

A = torch.randn(3, 4, 5)  # Tensor with dimensions (batch_size, M, N)
B = torch.randn(3, 5, 6)  # Tensor with dimensions (batch_size, N, P)

C = torch.matmul(A, B)    # Batched matrix multiplication, output tensor with dimensions (batch_size, M, P)
```
In this example, A and B are 3D tensors, and torch.matmul performs batched matrix multiplication resulting in the output tensor C with dimensions (3, 4, 6).

---

In PyTorch, the autograd system is designed to automatically compute gradients for tensors involved in differentiable operations. When a tensor is created with the requires_grad flag set to True, it will track the operations performed on it and build a computation graph. This computation graph is used later to compute gradients with respect to the tensor using the chain rule.

A tensor with requires_grad=True will have two main attributes:

.data: This attribute stores the actual tensor data (values).
.grad: This attribute stores the gradients computed during the backward pass.
For tensors with multiple elements (e.g., matrices), the .grad attribute will also be a tensor with the same shape as the .data attribute. Each element in the .grad tensor corresponds to the gradient of a specific element in the .data tensor.

When you call the .backward() method on a scalar tensor (usually the loss value in a deep learning model), PyTorch will traverse the computation graph in reverse order and compute the gradients for all tensors with requires_grad=True. The computed gradients are then accumulated in the .grad attribute of each tensor.

Here's a simple example:

```py
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0]], requires_grad=True)

z = x * y + y**2
loss = z.sum()

loss.backward()  # Compute gradients

print("x.grad:", x.grad)
print("y.grad:", y.grad)
```

In this example, x and y are 2x2 matrices, and both have requires_grad=True. We perform element-wise multiplication between x and y, and then add the element-wise square of y to get z. The loss is the sum of all elements in z. After calling loss.backward(), the gradients of the loss with respect to x and y are computed and stored in their respective .grad attributes.

---

Here's an example in C++ using the PyTorch C++ API (LibTorch) that is similar to the previous Python example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <torch/torch.h>

int main() {
  // Create 2x2 tensors with requires_grad=true
  torch::Tensor x = torch::tensor({{1.0, 2.0}, {3.0, 4.0}}, torch::requires_grad(true));
  torch::Tensor y = torch::tensor({{2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0}}, torch::requires_grad(true));

  // Compute z = x * y + y^2
  torch::Tensor z = x * y + torch::pow(y, 2);

  // Compute the loss as the sum of all elements in z
  torch::Tensor loss = z.sum();

  // Compute gradients
  loss.backward();

  // Print gradients
  std::cout << "x.grad: " << x.grad() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "y.grad: " << y.grad() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create 2x2 tensors x and y with requires_grad(true). We then compute z as the element-wise multiplication between x and y, plus the element-wise square of y. The loss is calculated as the sum of all elements in z. After calling loss.backward(), the gradients of the loss with respect to x and y are computed and stored in their respective .grad() attributes.

Note that in C++, you'll need to include the LibTorch header files and link against the LibTorch library when building your program. For more information on setting up and using the PyTorch C++ API, see the official documentation: https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/installing.html

Before diving into automatic differentiation (autograd) implementation, it's useful to implement some more basic mathematical operations and features for your Tensor class. These operations will come in handy when you start working on autograd, as they are essential for building more complex functions and models. Here are some suggestions:

- Element-wise operations: Implement element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two tensors with the same shape.

- Broadcasting: Add support for broadcasting, which is a powerful feature that allows you to perform operations on tensors with different shapes. It automatically expands the dimensions of the smaller tensor to match the larger one so that the operation can be performed element-wise. Broadcasting is widely used in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

- Reduction operations: Implement reduction operations like sum, mean, min, max, and product that can be performed along specific dimensions or the entire tensor.

- Unary operations: Add support for unary operations like absolute value, exponential, logarithm, square root, and trigonometric functions.

- Basic linear algebra operations: Besides matrix multiplication, consider implementing other linear algebra operations like transpose, inverse, determinant, and trace.

- Comparison operations: Implement element-wise comparison operations like equal, not equal, greater, less, greater equal, and less equal.

- Advanced indexing: Add support for more advanced indexing techniques like masking and integer array indexing.

Once you have these foundational mathematical operations and features implemented, you can start working on the autograd system. Implementing the autograd system will involve defining how gradients should be computed for each operation, as well as maintaining a computation graph to keep track of the operations and their corresponding gradients.

Keep in mind that implementing an efficient and robust autograd system can be quite complex. If you're interested in learning more about autograd implementation, you can study existing deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, which have well-developed autograd systems.

---

Yes, Micrograd is a minimalistic automatic differentiation (autograd) engine created by Andrej Karpathy. It's designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for building your own autograd system for tensors.

To create a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using your tensor library, you'll need the following components:

Basic tensor operations: As previously mentioned, you should have essential tensor operations implemented, like element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as matrix multiplication.

Activation functions: Implement popular activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh. These functions introduce non-linearity into the MLP, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data.

```cpp
template <typename T>
Tensor<T> relu(const Tensor<T> &input) {
  // Implement ReLU activation function
}

template <typename T>
Tensor<T> sigmoid(const Tensor<T> &input) {
  // Implement Sigmoid activation function
}

template <typename T>
Tensor<T> tanh(const Tensor<T> &input) {
  // Implement Tanh activation function
}
```

Loss functions: Implement common loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy Loss. Loss functions are used to measure the discrepancy between the predicted output and the ground truth during training.

```cpp
template <typename T>
T mse_loss(const Tensor<T> &predicted, const Tensor<T> &ground_truth) {
  // Implement Mean Squared Error loss function
}

template <typename T>
T cross_entropy_loss(const Tensor<T> &predicted, const Tensor<T> &ground_truth) {
  // Implement Cross-Entropy loss function
}
```
Automatic differentiation (autograd): Implement a simple autograd system for your tensor library, similar to Micrograd. This system should maintain a computation graph that keeps track of the operations and their gradients. Additionally, it should be able to compute gradients for the parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of the MLP during the backpropagation process.

Optimizers: Implement optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam to update the parameters (weights and biases) of the MLP during training. Optimizers are responsible for minimizing the loss function.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class SGD {
 public:
  // Implement the Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer
};
```

MLP architecture: Define the MLP architecture, which consists of multiple layers of linear transformations (matrix multiplication followed by the addition of biases) and activation functions. The number of layers and the size of each layer should be configurable.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class MultiLayerPerceptron {
 public:
  // Implement the MLP class with configurable layers and sizes
};
```

Training loop: Implement the training loop, where you feed data into the MLP, compute the loss, perform backpropagation to calculate gradients, and update the parameters using the optimizer.

Evaluation: Implement functions to evaluate the performance of your MLP on a validation or test dataset.

By implementing these components, you'll be able to create a simple MLP using your tensor library. Note that this is just a starting point, and there's a lot more that can be added and optimized for better performance and usability.

# Single Layer PyTorch

Sure, here's an example of a single-layer neural network in PyTorch with one output:

```py
import torch

# Define input data and target output
x = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8]])
y = torch.tensor([[0.5], [0.7], [0.9], [1.1]])

# Define the model
model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(2, 1),
)

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)

    # Compute loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()

    # Print progress
    if epoch % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss {loss.item()}")

# Test the model
x_test = torch.tensor([[0.9, 1.0], [1.1, 1.2]])
y_pred_test = model(x_test)
print(y_pred_test)
```
In this example, we define an input tensor x of shape (4, 2) and a target output tensor y of shape (4, 1). We define a Sequential model with a single linear layer using torch.nn.Linear(2, 1). We define a mean squared error (MSE) loss function using torch.nn.MSELoss() and an optimizer using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.1. We train the model for 1000 epochs and print the loss every 100 epochs. Finally, we test the model on some new input data x_test and print the predicted output y_pred_test.

---

Sure, here's how you can define a single-layer neural network with one output using PyTorch without using the Sequential module:

```py
import torch

# Define input data and target output
x = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8]])
y = torch.tensor([[0.5], [0.7], [0.9], [1.1]])

# Define the model
class SingleLayerNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SingleLayerNet, self).__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(2, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        y_pred = self.linear(x)
        return y_pred

model = SingleLayerNet()

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)

    # Compute loss
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Print progress
    if epoch % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss {loss.item()}")

# Test the model
x_test = torch.tensor([[0.9, 1.0], [1.1, 1.2]])
y_pred_test = model(x_test)
print(y_pred_test)
```
In this example, we define a class SingleLayerNet that inherits from torch.nn.Module and contains a single linear layer with 2 input features and 1 output feature. We define the forward method to perform the forward pass of the network. We instantiate the class to create the model. The rest of the code is the same as in the previous example.

        self.b = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1))

    def forward(self, x):
        y_pred = torch.mm(x, self.w) + self.b
        return y_pred

model = SingleLayerNet()

# Define the loss function
loss_fn = torch.nn.MSELoss()

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(1000):
    # Forward pass

y_pred_test = model(x_test)
print(y_pred_test)
```

In this example, we define a class SingleLayerNet that inherits from torch.nn.Module. The __init__ method initializes two trainable parameters self.w and self.b using torch.nn.Parameter, where self.w is a 2x1 weight matrix and self.b is a scalar bias term. The forward method performs a linear transformation of the input x using torch.mm to compute the matrix multiplication of x and self.w, and adds the bias term self.b. We instantiate the class to create the model. The rest of the code is the same as in the previous examples.

x = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8]])
y = torch.tensor([[0.5], [0.7], [0.9], [1.1]])

# Define the model weights and bias
w = torch.randn(2, 1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

# Define the model
def single_layer_net(x):
    y_pred = torch.matmul(x, w) + b
    return y_pred

# Define the loss function
def mse_loss(y_pred, y):
    loss = torch.mean(torch.pow(y_pred - y, 2))
    return loss

# Define the learning rate and number of epochs
lr = 0.1
num_epochs = 1000

# Train the model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = single_layer_net(x)

    # Compute loss
    loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update parameters
    with torch.no_grad():
        w -= lr * w.grad
        b -= lr * b.grad

        # Reset gradients
        w.grad.zero_()
        b.grad.zero_()

    # Print progress
    if epoch % 100 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss {loss.item()}")

# Test the model
x_test = torch.tensor([[0.9, 1.0], [1.1, 1.2]])
y_pred_test = single_layer_net(x_test)
print(y_pred_test)
```

In this example, we define the model weights w as a 2x1 tensor and the bias b as a 1-dimensional tensor. We define the single_layer_net function to perform a linear transformation of the input x using torch.matmul to compute the matrix multiplication of x and w, and adds the bias term b. We define the mse_loss function to compute the mean squared error loss between the predicted output and the target output. We define the learning rate lr and number of epochs num_epochs. We train the model using a for loop, where we perform a forward pass, compute the loss, perform a backward pass, and update the parameters using gradient descent. We print the loss every 100 epochs. Finally, we test the model on some new input data x_test and print the predicted output y_pred_test.

# broadcasting in neuron activation bias

In this code snippet, you are creating tensors using the PyTorch C++ API (LibTorch). The tensor b_aten represents a bias tensor, and it is added to the result of the matrix multiplication between x_aten and w_aten. Broadcasting is used here to perform the element-wise addition between tensors of different shapes.

To explain how broadcasting works in this scenario, let's first understand the shapes of the tensors involved:

x_aten: shape (3, 2)
w_aten: shape (2, 4)
b_aten: shape (1, 4) after unsqueezing
The matrix multiplication (matmul) between x_aten and w_aten results in a tensor matmul_result of shape (3, 4). Now, you want to add the bias tensor b_aten to this result.

Broadcasting rules in PyTorch (and NumPy) allow you to perform operations between tensors of different shapes as long as they are compatible. In this case, the tensors matmul_result (shape: (3, 4)) and b_aten (shape: (1, 4)) are compatible for broadcasting because their last dimensions match (4). When adding the bias tensor b_aten, broadcasting expands the tensor b_aten along the first dimension to match the shape of matmul_result, resulting in a tensor of shape (3, 4).

The expanded b_aten will look like this:

```
[
 [1, 2, 3, 4],
 [1, 2, 3, 4],
 [1, 2, 3, 4]
]
```
Each row of the expanded b_aten will be added element-wise to the corresponding row of matmul_result. It is not adding the bias to every element in the weights of the neurons, but rather to the result of the matrix multiplication. This makes sense because the bias values are applied to the output of the matrix multiplication, not directly to the neuron weights. The addition of biases in this way allows for a shift in the activation function, enabling the neural network to better learn and represent complex patterns in the data.

---

Yes, that's correct. In this case, the weights of the neurons are represented as rows in the weight tensor w_aten. When you perform x_aten.matmul(w_aten), you are computing the dot product between each row in x_aten and each column in w_aten. The result of this operation will be a new tensor where each element (i, j) represents the dot product of the i-th row of x_aten and the j-th column of w_aten. This means that each row in the resulting tensor corresponds to the weighted sum of the input features for each neuron.

When you add the bias tensor b_aten, the bias values are added element-wise to the result of the matrix multiplication, where each element in the bias tensor corresponds to a specific neuron. The broadcasting mechanism takes care of expanding the bias tensor to match the shape of the result, effectively adding the bias value to each neuron's output.

So, in this scenario, the rows in w_aten represent the weights of the neurons, and the bias tensor b_aten is added to the output of the matrix multiplication to shift the activation function for each neuron.

## Approaching autograd

Yes, it seems like you are ready to start adding an autograd type system to your tensor class. Your current implementation includes basic tensor functionality, such as reshaping, slicing, element-wise operations, and matrix multiplication. Adding autograd will enable you to compute gradients for operations performed on your tensors, which is essential for training neural networks and other machine learning models.

To implement the autograd type system, you can start by adding the following features:

1. Keep track of operations performed on the tensors and maintain a computation graph that stores the dependencies between tensors.

2. Implement a backward() method that computes the gradients of a tensor with respect to its inputs by performing backpropagation through the computation graph.

3. Implement gradient-aware versions of the basic operations (e.g., element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as matrix multiplication) so that they can be differentiated during backpropagation.

4. Add support for creating tensors that do not require gradients, which can be useful for saving memory and computational resources when training large models. For example, you might have a flag requires_grad for each tensor, and only track operations and gradients for tensors with this flag set to true.

Remember to test your implementation as you go, ensuring that the gradients are computed correctly for various tensor operations.

# c++ functors inlining

```cpp
template <typename T>
// requires T is TotallyOrdered
struct less {
  bool operator()(const T&, const T& b) const {
    return a < b;
  }
};
```

why use this function over a function pointer

---

Using a function object like the less struct instead of a function pointer has a few advantages in C++:

Inlined function calls: Function objects are typically inlined by the compiler, which can lead to better performance than using a function pointer. With function pointers, the compiler might not be able to inline the function call because the function's address is not known at compile-time. Inlining can improve performance by reducing the overhead of function calls and allowing the compiler to perform optimizations across the inlined code.

Template specialization: When using a function object, you can take advantage of template specialization to provide custom implementations for specific types. This can lead to more efficient and optimized code, as you can tailor the implementation for each type as needed.

Easier to extend: Function objects are more extensible than function pointers, as they can store state and have member functions. This allows you to create more complex and feature-rich comparison objects if needed.

Compatibility with Standard Library: The C++ Standard Library algorithms, such as sort, lower_bound, and upper_bound, expect function objects as their comparison predicates. By using a function object like less, you ensure that your code is easily compatible with these algorithms.

Readability and semantics: Using a function object like less can make your code more expressive and easier to understand. It clearly states the intent of the comparison, which can be helpful for code maintenance and readability.

In summary, using a function object instead of a function pointer can lead to better performance, more extensibility, and improved compatibility with the Standard Library algorithms.

std::sort(a.begin(), a.end(), less<int>())
why does the () in less<int> instantiate a type? usually you dont make types like this in c++, usally I do T a to make a variable `a` of type `T`

---

I apologize for the confusion. The expression less<int>() does not instantiate a type but an object of type less<int>. Let me clarify this:

When you use less<int>, you are specifying a template specialization for the less struct with the type int. This will create a new type less<int>, which is a struct with the same definition as the original less struct but with T replaced by int.

Now, the expression less<int>() creates an object of this new type less<int>. The () following the type name is a call to the default constructor of the struct less<int>. The constructor doesn't have any arguments and doesn't do anything in this case, but you still need to call it to create an object of that type.

The std::sort function expects a function object as its third argument, and by passing less<int>(), you are providing an object of type less<int> that can be used as a comparison function for sorting.

To sum it up, less<int> is a type, while less<int>() is an object of that type. The latter is used in the std::sort function to provide a comparison function object.

explain inlining to me

---

Inlining is an optimization technique performed by the compiler, where the body of a function is substituted directly at the point of its call, instead of invoking the function in the traditional way. By inlining a function, the compiler eliminates the overhead associated with function calls, such as setting up the call stack, passing arguments, and returning values. This can lead to improved performance, especially for small and frequently used functions.

When a function is inlined, the compiler effectively replaces the function call with the function's body, substituting any arguments as needed. This can lead to increased code size (also known as code bloat), as the function's body is duplicated at every call site. However, the trade-off is often worth it for the improved performance.

There are several advantages to inlining:

Reduced function call overhead: As mentioned earlier, inlining eliminates the overhead associated with function calls, including setting up the call stack, passing arguments, and returning values.

Optimization opportunities: By inlining a function, the compiler can perform optimizations across the inlined code and the calling function. This can lead to better performance, as the compiler can take

explain inlining to me visually with this example
```cpp
template <typename T>
// requires T is TotallyOrdered
struct less {
  bool operator()(const T&, const T& b) const {
    return a < b;
  }
};

// usage
std::sort(a.begin(), a.end(), less<int>())
```

---


Sure, let's visually explain inlining using the less struct and std::sort example.

Suppose you have a vector of integers a and you want to sort it using std::sort. Without inlining, the code would conceptually look like this:

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct less {
  bool operator()(const T& a, const T& b) const {
    return a < b;
  }
};

// Some code that initializes the vector 'a'

// Call std::sort using the 'less' struct
std::sort(a.begin(), a.end(), less<int>());
```

When the compiler inlines the less struct's operator() function, it would replace the function call with the function's body directly within the std::sort implementation. This would conceptually look like this:

```cpp
// Some code that initializes the vector 'a'

// Call std::sort using the 'less' struct, with inlining
std::sort(a.begin(), a.end(), /* less<int>::operator() inlined */ (const int& a, const int& b) { return a < b; });
```

Now, the std::sort implementation uses the inlined body of less<int>::operator() directly for comparison. This eliminates the need for a separate function call, reducing overhead, and allowing the compiler to perform further optimizations.

Please note that the code examples above are conceptual and don't necessarily represent the actual code generated by the compiler. The actual code generated may be more optimized and different from the examples provided. However, this should give you a visual understanding of how inlining works in this specific example.

show me what a function call looks like in risc-v

---

In RISC-V, a function call typically involves the following steps:

Save registers that need to be preserved across the function call (callee-saved registers).
Move the function arguments to the appropriate registers or the stack, as per the calling convention.
Jump to the function's address using the jal (Jump And Link) instruction.
Execute the function's code.
Move the return value to the appropriate register, as per the calling convention.
Restore the saved registers.
Return to the caller function.
Let's consider a simple example where a function foo takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. The C code would look like this:

```c
int foo(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
Here's an example of what the RISC-V assembly for the function call might look like:

```assembly
# The caller function

main:
    # Save callee-saved registers (if necessary)
    # ...

    # Move arguments to the appropriate registers
    li a0, 42          # a0 = 42 (first argument)
    li a1, 24          # a1 = 24 (second argument)

    # Call the 'foo' function
    jal ra, foo        # Jump to 'foo' and save the return address in 'ra'

    # Handle the return value (in this case, the sum is in 'a0')
    # ...

    # Restore callee-saved registers (if necessary)
    # ...

    # Return from the caller function
    ret

# The 'foo' function
foo:
    # Save callee-saved registers (if necessary)
    # ...

    # Perform the addition (a0 and a1 hold the arguments)
    add a0, a0, a1     # a0 = a0 + a1

    # Restore callee-saved registers (if necessary)
    # ...

    # Return from the function (the sum is in 'a0')
    ret
```

In this example, the function foo takes its arguments from the a0 and a1 registers, and the return value is stored in the a0 register. The jal instruction is used to jump to the function while saving the return address in the ra register. The ret instruction returns to the caller function using the address stored in the ra register.

Please note that this example is simplified for illustration purposes. In real-world scenarios, the assembly code may include additional instructions for stack manipulation, register saving/restoring, and other tasks depending on the function's complexity and the calling convention.

---

what does it mean by return address here

---

The return address is the memory address in the program where the execution should continue after a function call is completed. It is the point in the caller function immediately after the function call instruction.

When a function is called, the program needs to remember where to resume execution once the called function finishes its execution. This is where the return address comes into play.

In the RISC-V assembly example provided earlier, the jal (Jump And Link) instruction is used to call the foo function. This instruction does two things:

Jumps to the memory address of the foo function, starting its execution.
Saves the return address in the ra (return address) register.
The return address is the memory address of the instruction immediately following the jal instruction in the caller function. When the called function (in this case, foo) finishes its execution, it uses the ret instruction, which jumps back to the memory address stored in the ra register, effectively resuming the execution of the caller function.

In summary, the return address is the memory address where the execution of the caller function should continue after a called function completes its execution. This address is saved in the ra register in RISC-V when using the jal instruction for function calls.

---

can you show me risc v inlining in assembly generation in c++ add a + b

---

Sure! Let's consider a simple C++ example that adds two integers using a function and then show how inlining might look in RISC-V assembly.

Here is the C++ code:

```cpp
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int a = 42;
    int b = 24;
    int result = add(a, b);
    return 0;
}
```

When the compiler inlines the add function, the generated RISC-V assembly might look like this:

```assembly
# Initialize global pointer (gp) and stack pointer (sp)
lui gp, %hi(__global_pointer$)
addi gp, gp, %lo(__global_pointer$)
lui sp, %hi(__stack_pointer$)
addi sp, sp, %lo(__stack_pointer$)

# Main function
main:
    # Set up the stack frame
    addi sp, sp, -16
    sd ra, 8(sp)

    # Load the values of a and b into registers
    li t0, 42          # t0 = 42 (value of a)
    li t1, 24          # t1 = 24 (value of b)

    # Inlined code for the add function
    add t2, t0, t1     # t2 = t0 + t1 (result of a + b)

    # Store the result in memory (optional)
    sd t2, 0(sp)

    # Clean up the stack frame and return
    ld ra, 8(sp)
    addi sp, sp, 16
    ret
```

In this example, the add function's code (the addition operation) is inlined directly into the main function, eliminating the need for a separate function call. The add t2, t0, t1 instruction represents the inlined code, which adds the values in registers t0 and t1, and stores the result in register t2.

Please note that the provided assembly code is for illustration purposes only and might not match the exact code generated by a real compiler. The actual generated code may contain additional instructions for various tasks or be more optimized.

# jacobian

https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html
Generally speaking, torch.autograd is an engine for computing vector-Jacobian product.
explain this

---

In the context of deep learning, the autograd package in PyTorch provides automatic differentiation capabilities for tensor operations. The primary purpose of the autograd package is to compute gradients or derivatives of tensors, which are essential in optimizing neural networks using techniques like gradient descent.

The term "vector-Jacobian product" refers to the product of a vector and the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix is a matrix that contains all the first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function. In deep learning, this function typically represents the output of a neural network with respect to its parameters (e.g., weights and biases).

In other words, torch.autograd is an engine that automates the computation of gradients for tensors in a neural network. It does this by efficiently computing the vector-Jacobian product, which is used to update the model parameters during training.

Here's a high-level summary of how torch.autograd works:

Tensors in PyTorch have an attribute called requires_grad. When set to True, it starts to track all operations on the tensor. This allows the computation graph to be built as you perform operations on the tensor.
After completing the forward pass (computing the output of the neural network), you can call the .backward() method on the final output tensor (usually the loss function's output). This initiates the backward pass, which computes the gradients for all tensors with requires_grad=True.
The gradients are then stored in the .grad attribute of the corresponding tensors.
You can then use the computed gradients to update the model parameters (e.g., using an optimizer like stochastic gradient descent).
This process allows you to efficiently compute gradients for complex neural networks and update their parameters during training.

In deep learning, this function typically represents the output of a neural network with respect to its parameters (e.g., weights and biases).

please exand on this math with a simple example of tensor that is shape (2,1) and show me how C = A + B works in relation to this vector-jacobian product visually

---

Let's consider a simple example with tensors A and B, both of shape (2, 1). For the sake of simplicity, let's assume A and B are the result of some operations involving parameters of a neural network (weights and biases). We will compute the output tensor C and its gradients with respect to the input tensors A and B.

Suppose we have:
```
A = [[a1],
[a2]]

B = [[b1],
[b2]]
```
Now, we compute the output tensor C by element-wise addition:
```
C = A + B
C = [[a1 + b1],
[a2 + b2]]
```
Let's define the function f, which maps input tensors A and B to output tensor C:
```
f(A, B) = C
```
Now, we want to compute the Jacobian matrix of f with respect to A and B. The Jacobian matrix will have partial derivatives of each element in C with respect to each element in A and B.

Jacobian matrix of C with respect to A (J_A):
```
J_A = [[âˆ‚(a1 + b1)/âˆ‚a1, âˆ‚(a1 + b1)/âˆ‚a2],
[âˆ‚(a2 + b2)/âˆ‚a1, âˆ‚(a2 + b2)/âˆ‚a2]]
```
Calculating the partial derivatives, we get:
```
J_A = [[1, 0],
[0, 1]]
```
Similarly, we can compute the Jacobian matrix of C with respect to B (J_B):
```
J_B = [[âˆ‚(a1 + b1)/âˆ‚b1, âˆ‚(a1 + b1)/âˆ‚b2],
[âˆ‚(a2 + b2)/âˆ‚b1, âˆ‚(a2 + b2)/âˆ‚b2]]
```
And we have:
```
J_B = [[1, 0],
[0, 1]]
```
Now, let's consider the vector-Jacobian product. Suppose we have a gradient vector g that represents the gradients of a scalar loss function L with respect to the output tensor C:
```
g = [[âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a1 + b1)],
[âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a2 + b2)]]
```
To compute the gradients of the loss function L with respect to the input tensors A and B, we perform the vector-Jacobian product for both:

Gradients with respect to A:
```
g_A = g * J_A = [[âˆ‚L/âˆ‚a1], [âˆ‚L/âˆ‚a2]]
```
Gradients with respect to B:
```
g_B = g * J_B = [[âˆ‚L/âˆ‚b1], [âˆ‚L/âˆ‚b2]]
```
In this simple example, the Jacobian matrices are just identity matrices. However, for more complex operations and functions, the Jacobian matrices will contain different values, and the vector-Jacobian product will give us the gradients required for optimization.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems that I misunderstood your original question. Based on your clarification, you are looking for an explanation of the gradient computation for the simple expression graph C = A + B without involving a loss function.

Given the operation C = A + B, we have:
```
C = [[c1],
[c2]]
```
where c1 = a1 + b1 and c2 = a2 + b2.

Now, let's compute the gradients of C with respect to A and B:

Gradients with respect to A:
```
âˆ‚c1/âˆ‚a1 = 1
âˆ‚c2/âˆ‚a2 = 1
```
Gradients with respect to B:
```
âˆ‚c1/âˆ‚b1 = 1
âˆ‚c2/âˆ‚b2 = 1
```
The gradients of the output tensor C with respect to the input tensors A and B are all 1, as the relationship between the elements of A, B, and C in this simple expression graph is an element-wise addition.

The gradient computation, in this case, is straightforward, and there is no need to compute a vector-Jacobian product.

---

Yes, an expression graph with C = A * B (element-wise multiplication) would involve the vector-Jacobian product. Let's use a simple example to demonstrate this.

Given the operation C = A * B (element-wise multiplication), we have:
```
A = [[a1],
[a2]]
```
```
B = [[b1],
[b2]]
```
```
C = [[a1 * b1],
[a2 * b2]]
```
Now, let's compute the gradients of C with respect to A and B:

Gradients with respect to A:
```
âˆ‚c1/âˆ‚a1 = b1
âˆ‚c2/âˆ‚a2 = b2
```
Gradients with respect to B:
```
âˆ‚c1/âˆ‚b1 = a1
âˆ‚c2/âˆ‚b2 = a2
```
Notice that in this case, the gradients of the output tensor C with respect to the input tensors A and B depend on the elements of the other input tensor.

The Jacobian matrices for this expression graph would be:

Jacobian matrix of C with respect to A (J_A):
```
J_A = [[âˆ‚(a1 * b1)/âˆ‚a1, âˆ‚(a2 * b2)/âˆ‚a1],
[âˆ‚(a1 * b1)/âˆ‚a2, âˆ‚(a2 * b2)/âˆ‚a2]]
```
```
J_A = [[b1, 0],
[ 0, b2]]
```
Jacobian matrix of C with respect to B (J_B):
```
J_B = [[âˆ‚(a1 * b1)/âˆ‚b1, âˆ‚(a2 * b2)/âˆ‚b1],
[âˆ‚(a1 * b1)/âˆ‚b2, âˆ‚(a2 * b2)/âˆ‚b2]]
```
```
J_B = [[a1, 0],
[ 0, a2]]
```
Now, suppose we have a gradient vector g, which represents the gradients of a scalar value (for example, a loss function) with respect to the output tensor C:
```
g = [[âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a1 * b1)],
[âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a2 * b2)]]
```
To compute the gradients of this scalar value with respect to the input tensors A and B, we can perform the vector-Jacobian product for both J_A and J_B:

Gradients with respect to A:
```
g_A = J_A^T * g = [[b1 * âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a1 * b1)], [b2 * âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a2 * b2)]]
```
Gradients with respect to B:
```
g_B = J_B^T * g = [[a1 * âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a1 * b1)], [a2 * âˆ‚L/âˆ‚(a2 * b2)]]
```
This example demonstrates the simplest possible scenario involving the vector-Jacobian product for an expression graph with element-wise multiplication.

whats the point of having two jacobian matrixes? i guess in this example A and B are is_leaf?

---

In this example, A and B are considered leaf nodes or leaf tensors, meaning that they do not result from any operations in the expression graph. They can be seen as the inputs to the graph. The reason we have two Jacobian matrices is that we want to compute the gradients of an output tensor (C) with respect to both input tensors (A and B).

Each Jacobian matrix represents the relationship between the output tensor C and one of the input tensors (either A or B). When we compute the gradients of a scalar value (such as a loss function) with respect to the input tensors A and B, we need to know how the output tensor C changes with respect to each input tensor. The Jacobian matrices capture these relationships.

In the given example:

The Jacobian matrix J_A represents how the output tensor C changes with respect to the input tensor A, holding B constant.
The Jacobian matrix J_B represents how the output tensor C changes with respect to the input tensor B, holding A constant.
When we compute the gradients of a scalar value (e.g., a loss function) with respect to the input tensors A and B, we use these Jacobian matrices to apply the chain rule of calculus, which allows us to propagate the gradients from the output tensor C back to the input tensors A and B.

In more complex expression graphs, there could be multiple operations and intermediate tensors between the input and output tensors. In such cases, the Jacobian matrices would capture the relationship between the output tensor and each intermediate tensor, as well as the input tensors. This enables the computation of gradients with respect to all the learnable parameters in the graph, which is essential for training neural networks and optimizing the model parameters.

can you remind me why we call .backward() on the final output tensor, is it because for every element in the output tensor C the C.grad = [1,1] as the derivative of it's element with respect to itself is 1, and then using the chain rule and the local derivatives we can back propogate to the leaf nodes

---

Yes, that's correct! When you call .backward() on the final output tensor, you are essentially computing the gradients of the output tensor with respect to itself and then using the chain rule to backpropagate the gradients to the leaf nodes (input tensors).

In PyTorch, when you call .backward() on a scalar output tensor (usually a loss function value), the gradient of the output tensor with respect to itself is implicitly set to 1. This is because the derivative of a scalar value with respect to itself is always 1.

For a non-scalar output tensor, you need to provide an appropriate gradient tensor (with the same shape as the output tensor) as an argument to the .backward() function. This gradient tensor contains the gradients of a scalar value (usually a loss function value) with respect to the elements of the output tensor.

Once you have the gradients of the output tensor, you can use the chain rule to backpropagate these gradients through the expression graph to the leaf nodes (input tensors). The chain rule is applied by multiplying the gradients of the output tensor by the local derivatives (Jacobian matrices) at each intermediate tensor and operation in the graph.

This process of backpropagation allows you to compute the gradients of a scalar value (e.g., a loss function) with respect to all the learnable parameters (leaf tensors) in the expression graph. These gradients are then used to update the model parameters during the optimization process, such as gradient descent or any of its variants.

what is the C.grad tensor values in the expresion graph C = A*B and C = A+B, are the different? what is the shape of the C.grad tensor if A and B are (2,1) shape

---

In the expression graphs C = A * B and C = A + B, the C.grad tensor stores the gradients of a scalar value (usually a loss function) with respect to the elements of the output tensor C. The shape of the C.grad tensor will be the same as the shape of the output tensor C, which in this case is (2, 1).

However, the values of the C.grad tensor depend on the expression graph and the gradients of the scalar value with respect to the elements of C. Let's consider two simple cases for each expression graph:
```
C = A * B (element-wise multiplication):
A = [[a1],
[a2]]

B = [[b1],
[b2]]

C = [[a1 * b1],
[a2 * b2]]
```
If we assume that the gradient of a scalar value with respect to the elements of C is [1, 1], then the C.grad tensor will be:
```
C.grad = [[1],
[1]]

C = A + B (element-wise addition):
A = [[a1],
[a2]]

B = [[b1],
[b2]]

C = [[a1 + b1],
[a2 + b2]]
```
Again, assuming that the gradient of a scalar value with respect to the elements of C is [1, 1], the C.grad tensor will be:
```
C.grad = [[1],
[1]]
```
In both cases, the shape of the C.grad tensor is (2, 1), and its values are the same because we assumed the gradients of the scalar value with respect to the elements of C are [1, 1]. However, when backpropagating these gradients to the input tensors A and B, the gradients with respect to A and B will be different because of the different operations (multiplication vs. addition) in the expression graphs.
